Note to TA:

My code runs very slowly (it takes about 2-3 minutes to fully run). 
I have tried some optimizations, including reducing function calls,
but it still runs pretty slowly. It seems to be from too many calls
to numpy functions and numpy's array library. Also, Python tends to
run slowly when doing many computations over a nested for-loop with
many iterations. The code does work though.

Like in my previous programs, this program implements pyparsing.

This program has 3 essential command line arguments (besides the 
program name).

In python shaded.py 2 500 500 < cube3.iv,
the 2 represents phong shading (0 represents flat shading, and 1 
represents gouraud shading). The first 500 is the number of horizontal
pixels. The 2nd 500 is the number of vertical pixels. Finally,
cube3.iv is the input file. cube3.ppm will be outputted.

This program implements faint light. To use the faint light, add
--eyelight to the end of the command line arguments. So, one example
would be:

python shaded.py 2 500 500 --eyelight < cube3.iv

To not implement faint light, just do

python shaded py 2 500 500 < cube3.iv

If you have any questions, please let me know at neto@caltech.edu.

Thanks!
