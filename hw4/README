Shaded Renderer in OpenGL

The command is of the form

python oglRenderer.py 2 500 500 cube2.iv 

The first command line argument, 2 in this example, is to determine the type of shading.
0 is wireframe
1 is Flat shading
2 is Gouraud Shading

The next two command line arguments, 500 and 500 in this example, are the window size
They are in pixels. So, in this case, a 500x500 window will pop up.

Finally, the last command line argument is the .iv file to render. Here,
it is cube2.iv

As usual, this lab requires pyparsing and numpy, as detailed in my earlier labs.
