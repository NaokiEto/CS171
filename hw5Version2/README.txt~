One example to run this program is:

python editspline.py 500 500

The 1st and 2nd command line arguments (500 and 500 in this example)
are the width and height of the new window in terms of pixels

To move the control points, left click exactly on the control (very small
deviatiion from the control point is ok, but I didn't make it too big) and
move it around

It will take  few seconds to update the spline and control point position.

To insert knots, right click somewhere on the spline.
