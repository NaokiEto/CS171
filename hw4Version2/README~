Shaded Renderer in OpenGL



The command is of the form



python oglRenderer.py 2 500 500 cube2.iv 



The first command line argument, 2 in this example, is to determine the type of shading.


0 is wireframe

1 is Flat shading

2 is Gouraud Shading

The next two command line arguments, 500 and 500 in this example, are the window size


They are in pixels. So, in this case, a 500x500 window will pop up.


Finally, the last command line argument is the .iv file to render. Here,
it is cube2.iv



As usual, this lab requires pyparsing and numpy, as detailed in my earlier labs.



The mouse commands are that the left mouse button, when pressed down, will rotate the object.

If only the right mouse button is pressed down, then the user can translate the object.

If the right mouse button and the keyboard shift button are both pressed down, then the user can zoom in/out the object.


Please wait a few seconds for it to render the larger .iv files
